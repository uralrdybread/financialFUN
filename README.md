I also created a google workspace for this company and every employee had a working email address with scheduling calendar that worked hand-in-hand with our advisory survey page. 
In the survey page you answered a few questions and clicked the corresponding radio button to be assigned a financial officer 
who most reflects your goals. After the survey is complete and the user clicks submit they are taken to an advisors google calendar 
where they can schedule a free consultation. The code for this survey system can be seen on the survey component provided. 
The calendar is dynamic and interviews may only be assigned during business hours in 30 minute blocks. 
A verified email account is needed to prevent funny business and the scheduling may be changed at any time with notifications of 
changes being sent to each party.
